# StudentEnrolementProject
The repository provides a  Python framework for  the student  enrollment project

Have created a very simple and easily usable frame work using python.

Please run RunTests.py  This will run all the test scenarios that are in StudentAppTestCases.xlsx and provide you with an excel file (TestResults_<timestamp>.xlsx) with all details. You have option to selectively run the tests too 

Attached a excel report TestResults_1659899116.xlsx that was generated by the code and you may review it to understand the construct. 
  
When a new Test Result is generated, please expand the column size of the report for better readability
